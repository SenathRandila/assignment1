                <li style="color:white"><strong>My favourite pastime is to lose myself in a good book. I appreciate reading literature<br> because it may be a source of joy to become immersed in a great story or learn something new,<br /> whether it's nonfiction, fiction, or poetry.</strong></li>
                <li style="color: white"><strong>I enjoy going outside, whether for a leisurely stroll through a park, a hike along a scenic<br /> path or simply taking in the calm and quiet of nature. When I connect with nature, I am able to relax<br /> and appreciate the beauty of my surroundings.</strong></li>
                <li style="color: white "><strong>Another thing I enjoy doing is photographing events. I can express my creativity and <br />visually capture memories through photography, whether I'm documenting everyday life or looking for<br /> interesting locales.</strong></li>
                <li style="color: white "><strong>For me, exploring new recipes and cooking delicious meals is a rewarding and soothing activity.<br /> I enjoy cooking and sharing my creations with friends and family, whether they're<br /> savoury or sweet.</strong></li>
                <li style="color: white "><strong>I believe it is critical to lead an active lifestyle, and I love a variety of fitness-related<br /> activities such as yoga, jogging, and going to the gym. It's a great method for me to <br />relax and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</strong></li>
                <li style="color: white "><strong>Music occupies a significant portion of my spare time, whether I'm creating playlists, <br />attending live events, or simply discovering new performers. I adore experimenting with different<br /> genres and experiencing the emotions that music creates.</strong></li>
